# Project Description
This project had students implemenet a dynamic memory allocation and deallocation system using binary search trees. With an array representation of computer memory, the binary search tree consisted of nodes containing the location of free memory blocks and the size of each. Furthermore, a list structure was used to test the dynamical memory allocation and deallocation system with inputs coming from a text file or inputted directly from stdin.

## Learning Objectives
This cumulative project tested students' comprehension of **dynamical memory allocation and deallocation**. A solid grasp of the **binary search tree** and **list ADT**, along with their **function implementations**, were required to construct the system. **C pointers** and **structures** were necessary to accurately implement the ADTS and their functions. Finally, the project was to be organized in multiple files and converted to a **Makefile** for submission.

## How to Run
The C files were submitted over PuTTY on the university's network. UNIX commands were implemented to compile the C source code into object code and then to an executable file. Users can also run the program through an online IDE with a built in C-compiler. The website used for testing purposes was [repl.it](repl.it/~). 
To run the program, run Main and follow the on-screen prompts. Press *CTRL-D* to finish inputting to stdin.
