# Project Description
This assignment consisted of two parts:
* The first part was to construct a Binary Search Tree using an array of tree nodes.
* The second part was to write a program that could approximate e to a particular degree of precision.

## Learning Objectives
The first part introduced students to the implementation of a **Binary Search Tree** and its **major methods** in C. In order to do so, students were exposed to **arrays, strings, structures, pointers,** and more **recursion**. To strengthen best practices in programming, students were also tasked to consider dynamic memory allocation and the handling of multiple source files.
The second part exposed students to the **double** and **long long** C types, and it further strengthened the concept of recursion.

## How to Run
The C files were submitted over PuTTY on the university's network. UNIX commands were implemented to compile the C source code into object code and then to an executable file. Users can also run the program through an online IDE with a built in C-compiler. The website used for testing purposes was [repl.it](repl.it/~)
