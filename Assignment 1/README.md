# Project Description
This assignment consisted of two components:
* The first part was to create a program that could convert between Kilometers and Miles, Meters and Feet, Centimeters and Inch, and Celcius and Fahrenheit.
* The second part was to create an exponential number calculator.

## Learning Objectives
As the first introduction to C programming, students were made familiar with the **C language syntax** through the first part, while they also learned to implement **recursive algorithms** through the second.

## How to Run
The C files were submitted over PuTTY on the university's network. UNIX commands were implemented to compile the C source code into object code and then to an executable file.
Users can also run the program through an online IDE with a built in C-compiler. The website used for testing purposes was [repl.it](https://repl.it/)
