# Project Description
This assignment consisted of two parts:
* The first part was to create a program that could evalue arithmetic expressions from stdin.
* The second part was to create a program that could represent an integer using a seven-segment display.

## Learning Objective
The first part familiarized students with C types, stardard input and output streams, flow control structures, and recursion.
The second part introduced multi-dimensional arrays and global variables.

## How to Run
The C files were submitted over PuTTY on the university's network. UNIX commands were implemented to compile the C source code into object code and then to an executable file. Users can also run the program through an online IDE with a built in C-compiler. The website used for testing purposes was [repl.it](repl.it/).
